* var_dicex_base_dir/dicex/dicex.sh is necessary

*Issues 
** Random crash
** crash when using large number of interventions
** very brittle/naive message passing scheme (severly increases time to implement generic interventions)
** whenever we try to use it to write papers, do serious things,  it crashes.
** access to database is serialized
** known race condition  at startup
** extermely slow inserts to the database

* Testing (very useful for development)
** use unit_tests.py to test new replicate config generation utility
*** first launch a working config file-- go to the working directory on the dbcompute node
*** from there modify code etc. and then do 
*** python ~/git_repos/dicex_epistudy/unit_tests.py epistudy_cfg.xml


* How is a cell represented
* From cell to actual configuration
a cell is an entire xml file

* Somethings to watch out for
** indemics server port is fixed to 5461
** Intervention file is build seperately from replicate config file


* Launch study step by step
** Launch a dbsession
** call postdb.py (check the qsub file in the tmp dir)


* Analysis library
** unify_studycfg_rmos : bring all the records in one table
** plot_studycfg_rmos_stats_by_grouping
** To build out the renewed analysis routine --look into pre_analysis_setup_v2


* Load external datasets
** load_model_data_from_edcfg 
*** keywords
var_region
var_metadata_dir
var_model_dir
var_model_prefix
** load_model_data_from_gp_pipeline
