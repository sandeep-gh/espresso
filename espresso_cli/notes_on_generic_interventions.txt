The edges of the contact network  are labeled. 
For epifast, the labels have to be a number from 1 till 5. 
The meaning of the labels is dependent upon contact. 
For synthetic population 1 implies household edges,
2 imples work edges, 3 is school edges and so on.

But some other network can place different meaning 
to the edges. For the zika network: 
1 is a morning edge
2 is an afternoon edge
3 is an evening edge
and 
4 is a night edge.

In addition to predefined interventions "such as school closure, work closure" 
there is way to arbitrary change the weights of the edge for each type.
The set intervention directive looks as follows:
    	echo "set interventions: <intv-id>,<intv_type>,<compliance>,<duration>,<delay>,0.1#0.2#0.3#0.4#0.5,0.9#0.10#0.20#0.30#0.40, select lid from grid_locations where lid> 0 order by random() limit 10;"


The <intv-id> is an indentifier. One ususally a sequence from 0.
The <intv-type> is the type of intervention. For generic it is 8. 
<compliance>,<duration>,<delay> have their usual meaning

This is the main argument of generic intervention:
0.1#0.2#0.3#0.4#0.5,0.9#0.10#0.20#0.30#0.40

It is two sets of strings:
0.1#0.2#0.3#0.4#0.5
and
0.9#0.10#0.20#0.30#0.40

Both are five float values separate by delimiter "#"

The first one denotes scaling for edges from type 1 to type 5 for in-edges
and the second one denotes scaling for edge from type 1 to type 5 for out-going edges. 

For ebola when a person is admitted to hospitable, he/she is not in contact with any of its edges
the generic intvention looks as follows:
set interventions: <intv-id>,8,1.0,<duration-of-stay-in-hospital>,0,0.0#0.0#0.0#0.0#0.0,0.0#0.0#0.0#0.00#0.00, select lid from grid_locations where lid> 0 order by random() limit 10;

essentially scale all outgoing and incoming edges to zero.

for zika the edge weights for the location depend upon the ode function for the corresponding grid cells.
