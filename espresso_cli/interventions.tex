\chapter{Introduction}
\textbf{Modeling Interventions using Tables}: The data stored in the database can be classified into two main types: base and dynamic.
Base tables contain data corresponding to the demographic attributes associated with an individual or social contact network that represents 
the interaction between people. Dynamic tables contain temporal data (also known as dendogram) about the disease transmission network i.e. information about 
when an individual gets infected, individual who transmitted the infection, and so forth.  \\

\label{table:Epidemiological case studies}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline 
 \textbf{Intervention Study} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
 Targeted  & provide antiviral to diagnosed people \\ \hline
 Triggered & apply intervention to protect some subpopulation universally \\ \hline
 Household & all household members take preventive actions if anyone in \\
					 & the household is diagnosed \\ \hline
 Sick leave       & the diagnosed employees in the companies complying the policy \\ 
	(honest case) 	& will stay at home from the diagnosis day to the recovering day \\ \hline 	
 Sick leave       & the diagnosed employees in the companies complying the policy \\
	(rational case) & will stay at home for the max sick-leave period \\ \hline
 Block & vaccinate all people in any block if the fraction of diagnosed \\ 
			 & people in that block exceeds some threshold \\ \hline
 School & close any school if the fraction of diagnosed students exceeds 5\% \\ \hline
 Distance-1 & close any school if the fraction of diagnosed students exceeds 5\% \\ \hline
